    "### Cybersecurity Theory: SIEM & Log Analysis\n",
    "In cybersecurity, we use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems. Think of a SIEM as a giant vacuum cleaner that sucks up logs from every server, firewall, and database in a company and looks for patterns.\n",
    "- Log Analysis: The process of reviewing records of events. A log entry usually contains: Timestamp, IP Address, Action Taken, and Status.\n",
    "- Anomaly Detection: Finding the \"needle in the haystack.\" If a user usually logs in from New York at 9:00 AM, but suddenly logs in from London at 3:00 AM and tries to download 50GB of data, that is an anomaly."
