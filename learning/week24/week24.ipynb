    "### OWASP Top 10 for LLMs (The \"Big Three\" Focus)\n",
    "- LLM01: Prompt Injection: * Direct: The \"Jailbreak\" (User tricks the bot).\n",
    "    - Indirect: The \"Hidden Payload\" (Malicious instructions hidden in a website or PDF the bot reads).\n",
    "- LLM06: Excessive Agency: The danger of granting an LLM too much \"autonomy.\" If a bot has the power to delete_user(), a prompt injection can lead to catastrophic data loss.\n",
    "- LLM02: Sensitive Information Disclosure: The risk of the model \"memorizing\" and then revealing PII (emails, keys) from its training data or retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Defense-in-Depth Strategy\n",
    "- Layer 1: Identity & Access Management (IAM): The LLM should only have access to data the current user is authorized to see.\n",
    "- Layer 2: Input Sanitization: Using regex, blocklists, and \"Intent Classifiers\" to stop injections before they reach the model.\n",
    "- Layer 3: Output Validation: Using \"Post-processors\" to scan the LLM's response for secrets or forbidden code before the user sees it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Teaming & Adversarial Testing\n",
    "- Black-Box Testing: Testing the system without knowing its system prompt or architecture (simulating an outside hacker).\n",
    "- Payload Splitting: Breaking a malicious command into 10 separate, innocent-looking chat messages to bypass a single-message filter.\n",
    "- Adversarial Suffixes: Discovering specific \"gibberish\" strings that, when added to a prompt, statistically force the LLM to ignore its safety training.\n",

    "### Deterministic Layer\n",
    "- The \"Sandboxed\" Execution: The theory that any code the LLM generates must be treated as malicious by default and executed in an environment with no network access and limited CPU/RAM.\n",
    "- Indirect Prompt Injection: The \"silent killer\" of RAG—where a model visits a website or reads a file that contains hidden instructions meant to hijack the session.\n",
    "- The Trust Boundary: Defining exactly where your application stops and the \"untrusted\" LLM begins.\n",
    "- Egress Filtering: Not just watching what comes in (Input), but strictly controlling what goes out (Output) to prevent data exfiltration.\n"
