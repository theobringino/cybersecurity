    "### The Stages of Incident Response (IR Lifecycle)\n",
    "This is a continuous loop, not a linear process.\n",
    "1. Preparation\n",
    "    - Goal: To establish the necessary tools, policies, and training before an incident occurs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Key Activities:\n",
    "    - Developing clear IR Policies and Procedures.\n",
    "    - Building the Incident Response Team (IRT) and defining roles/responsibilities.\n",
    "    - Training and conducting drills (e.g., tabletop exercises).\n",
    "    - Ensuring systems have proper logging, monitoring, and backups.\n",
    "    - Maintaining current contact lists (internal and external).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Detection & Analysis\n",
    "    - Goal: To determine if an incident has occurred and, if so, its scope, nature, and severity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Key Activities:\n",
    "    - Monitoring/Alerting: Reviewing logs, SIEM alerts, and IDS/IPS detections.\n",
    "    - Validation: Confirming that an alert is a genuine incident, not a false positive.\n",
    "    - Triage: Prioritizing incidents based on business impact and severity.\n",
    "    - Documentation: Recording initial observations, timelines, and impact assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Containment\n",
    "    - Goal: To limit the scope and magnitude of the incident and prevent further damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Key Activities (in order of priority):\n",
    "    - Short-Term Containment: Isolating the affected systems (e.g., firewall rule, network segmentation).\n",
    "    - System Acquisition (Forensics): Creating forensic images of compromised systems for evidence.\n",
    "    - Long-Term Containment: Implementing temporary fixes or patches to allow business continuity while planning eradication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Eradication & Recovery\n",
    "    - Goal: To remove the threat and restore systems to a secure, pre-incident state.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Key Activities:\n",
    "    - Eradication: Removing all traces of the attacker, malware, backdoors, and malicious user accounts. This requires root-cause analysis (what was the initial vulnerability?).\n",
    "    - Validation: Ensuring the threat is fully gone before recovery.\n",
    "    - Recovery: Restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding infected systems, and ensuring all services are functional and monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned)\n",
    "    - Goal: To use the incident as a learning opportunity to improve future security and response.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Key Activities:\n",
    "    - Lessons Learned Meeting: Reviewing the entire process—what worked, what failed, and what can be improved.\n",
    "    - Incident Report: Creating a final, detailed report on the incident, costs, and findings.\n",
    "    - Policy/Control Updates: Implementing new security controls, updating policies, and re-training staff based on the report."
