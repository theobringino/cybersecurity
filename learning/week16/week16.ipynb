    "This is a continuous loop, not a linear process.\n",
    "1. Preparation\n",
    "    - Goal: To establish the necessary tools, policies, and training before an incident occurs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Key Activities:\n",
    "    - Developing clear IR Policies and Procedures.\n",
    "    - Building the Incident Response Team (IRT) and defining roles/responsibilities.\n",
    "    - Training and conducting drills (e.g., tabletop exercises).\n",
    "    - Ensuring systems have proper logging, monitoring, and backups.\n",
    "    - Maintaining current contact lists (internal and external).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Detection & Analysis\n",
    "    - Goal: To determine if an incident has occurred and, if so, its scope, nature, and severity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Key Activities:\n",
    "    - Monitoring/Alerting: Reviewing logs, SIEM alerts, and IDS/IPS detections.\n",
    "    - Validation: Confirming that an alert is a genuine incident, not a false positive.\n",
    "    - Triage: Prioritizing incidents based on business impact and severity.\n",
    "    - Documentation: Recording initial observations, timelines, and impact assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Containment\n",
    "    - Goal: To limit the scope and magnitude of the incident and prevent further damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Key Activities (in order of priority):\n",
    "    - Short-Term Containment: Isolating the affected systems (e.g., firewall rule, network segmentation).\n",
    "    - System Acquisition (Forensics): Creating forensic images of compromised systems for evidence.\n",
    "    - Long-Term Containment: Implementing temporary fixes or patches to allow business continuity while planning eradication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Eradication & Recovery\n",
    "    - Goal: To remove the threat and restore systems to a secure, pre-incident state.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Key Activities:\n",
    "    - Eradication: Removing all traces of the attacker, malware, backdoors, and malicious user accounts. This requires root-cause analysis (what was the initial vulnerability?).\n",
    "    - Validation: Ensuring the threat is fully gone before recovery.\n",
    "    - Recovery: Restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding infected systems, and ensuring all services are functional and monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned)\n",
    "    - Goal: To use the incident as a learning opportunity to improve future security and response.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Key Activities:\n",
    "    - Lessons Learned Meeting: Reviewing the entire process—what worked, what failed, and what can be improved.\n",
    "    - Incident Report: Creating a final, detailed report on the incident, costs, and findings.\n",
    "    - Policy/Control Updates: Implementing new security controls, updating policies, and re-training staff based on the report."

    "|IR Impact|By providing a high-confidence signal that a known malicious sequence is occurring, the LSTM significantly reduces triage time. This allows the IR team to skip manual analysis and move directly and rapidly into the Containment phase, minimizing the attacker's dwell time and the overall impact of the incident.|"
