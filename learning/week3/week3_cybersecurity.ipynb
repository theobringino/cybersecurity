    "IP is used to communicate across networks, not just across physical links, but between networks of routers. The addressing scheme in use is either IPv4 (\"IP Version 4\") or IPv6 (\"IP Version 6\").\n",
    "\n",
    "IP networks can be broken into different sections, often called subnets. This is accomplished by adding an extra piece of information, together with the IP address, called a netmask. The netmask dictates how large a network is and which packet is routed within the network and which should be routed outside of the network.\n",

    "Each network has a reserved address for broadcasting traffic to every host in the network, this is called the broadcast address. Broadcasting data means sending data to everyone on the network instead of sending to just a single host. There are many applications and protocols which rely on broadcasting traffic in order for them to work.\n",

    "For each network segment the broadcast is always last IP address in the network. For example in the network 192.168.0.0/24 network, the broadcast address is 192.168.0.255.\n",

    "In IP networks the traffic is routed by a router. A router is a networking device which understands the IP format and can forward packets between networks. This is different than a switch as the switch forwards data within a network, while the router forwards between networks.\n",
