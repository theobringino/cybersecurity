    "1. Decompose the Application: Visualize the system, often using a Data Flow Diagram (DFD), to identify components (processes, data stores, external entities) and the flows between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify Trust Boundaries: Note where the level of trust changes (e.g., between the web browser and the web server, or the web server and the database). Threats are often found when crossing these boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Apply STRIDE: Systematically examine each component and data flow, asking how each of the six STRIDE threats could apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Determine Mitigations: Propose security controls to reduce the risk posed by the identified threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Review and Iterate: Threat modeling should be a continuous process, especially when the system's architecture changes."
