    "Understand the concept of defense-in-depth and how a layered approach to security is a core engineering practice.\n",
    "- Learn about Security Principles: Understand the principles of \"fail-safe\" (a system that defaults to a safe state upon failure, e.g., a traffic light stuck on red) and \"fail-secure\" (a system that defaults to a secure/locked state upon failure, e.g., a server logging out all users if a security service fails).\n",

    "Defense-in-Depth: Understand how a multi-layered security approach is stronger than relying on a single defense mechanism (e.g., using a firewall, an intrusion detection system, and user authentication together).\n",

    "Diagram a hypothetical system and add multiple layers of security (e.g., a firewall, an intrusion detection system, and user authentication)."
