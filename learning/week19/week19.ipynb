    "#### Identity and Access Management (IAM)\n",
    "IAM is the system that manages who can do what on which resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Roles and Policies: You don't grant direct access; instead, you create policies (JSON documents) that define permissions (e.g., s3:GetObject on a specific bucket). You then assign these policies to a user, group, or role.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Least-Privilege Principle\n",
    "    - This principle states that a user, service account, or resource should only be granted the minimum permissions necessary to perform its intended job—no more, no less.\n",
    "    - Example: If your serverless function only needs to read a file from a storage bucket to run your AI model, its associated IAM role should only have storage:read permission on that specific bucket, and nothing else (no write, delete, or access to other resources). This minimizes the potential damage if the function or its credentials are ever compromised.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Cloud Firewalls and Security Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools control network traffic, acting as a virtual barrier to protect your cloud resources.\n",
    " - Cloud Firewalls (Network-Level): These operate at the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) level and control traffic flowing in and out of your entire network. They are generally used for broad, network-wide rules.\n",
    " - Security Groups (Resource-Level): These act as a virtual firewall for a specific resource, such as a serverless function, Virtual Machine (VM), or database.\n",
    "    - They are stateful: if a request is allowed in, the response is automatically allowed out.\n",
    "    - They define rules based on Protocol (TCP, UDP), Port (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS), and Source/Destination IP addresses.\n",
    "    - For your serverless deployment: You will likely use a Security Group to ensure only the necessary ports are open to the internet, or to restrict inbound traffic to your API Gateway.\n"
