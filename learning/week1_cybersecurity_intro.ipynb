    "\n",
    "CIA triad is a model in information security that outlines three key principles. These principles serve as a guide for developing security systems and policies to ensure that the data and systems are protected from threats. These pillars of information security also represent the foundational principle in cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more indepth background, refer to the first link above:\n",
    "\n",
    "*C = Confidentiality*\n",
    "- This refers to protecting information from unauthorized access. It also ensures that sensitive data is only accessible by those who are authorized to see it.\n",
    "- A key component of this principle is making sure that people without proper authorization or access are prevented from accessing assets important to your system. Conversely, this also ensures that those who need access have the necessary privileges in place.\n",
    "- Data encryption, authentication (2FA), and requiring certain routing numbers or information before proceeding with transactions are covered here.\n",
    "- Biometrics verification, security tokens, key fobs, and soft tokens are also ways that help with confidentiality.\n",
    "- To protect the integrity of your data, you can use hashing, encryption, digital certificates, or digital signatures. For websites, you can employ trustworthy certificate authorities (CAs) that verify the authenticity of your website so visitors know they are getting the site they intended to visit. \n",
    "\n",
    "*I = Integrity* \n",
    "- Focuses on maintaining the accuracy and completeness of the data, ensuring that the information is not altered or modified without authorization. This also means guarding the data from improper modification or destruction.\n",
    "- Highlights that data should be trustworthy and no risk of tampering, alterations, or modifications will happen to the data.\n",
    "- Ensures non-repudiation and authenticity of the data.\n",
    "- This principles covers the data in storage, during processing, and while in transit.\n",
    "- Destructive malware, ransomware, malicious insider activity and even honest mistakes can affect integrity.\n",
    "- Backups, checksums, and metadata for evidence are included here to ensure that there are no mistakes made and we are able to pinpoint who made these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A = Availabilty*\n",
    "- Ensures that authorized users have timely and reliable access to information and resources when they need them.\n",
    "- This means that there are certain systems or safe guards in place that makes the data available in consideration of unpredictable events (such as interruptions, natural disasters, accidents, and even tech issues).\n",
